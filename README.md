**What is it?**

This is a simple Python web application which I have done to simplify my working process as marketing specialist.

At the end of every month I create a summarized report, which includes some figures about the number of applications received.
Previously (before I had applied) it was calculated manually, so I've decided to automatize it.

**What this program does?**

This program transforms uploaded excel spreadsheet to pivot table with some additional info.
Excel spreadsheets must have specific columns, so I added an example in file **'Test_data.xlsx'**.

**To use this programm you have to:**

1) Start file 'leads_report.py' by using command **_streamlit run leads_report.py_**
2) Drag and drop or select excel file, which you need to agregate. The example of spreadshhet you can find in file **'Test_data.xlsx'**.
3) Use left sidebar to choose which categories will be inncluded in calculations.
